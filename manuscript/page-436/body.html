Stephen Clark&rsquo;s wife had been dead for two years and he hadn&rsquo;t taken much notice of anybody, so far as was known. But Carmody had Jane Miranda all ready for him, and really I don&rsquo;t know why she didn&rsquo;t suit him, except for the reason that a man never does what he is expected to do when it comes to marrying.</p></div> </div>
