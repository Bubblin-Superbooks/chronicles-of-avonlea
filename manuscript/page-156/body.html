That last thing you played took me straight to heaven,&mdash;but heaven&rsquo;s awful near to hell, and at the last you tipped me in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Felix, drawing his fine, narrow black brows together in a perplexed frown.</p><p>&ldquo;No&mdash;and I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to. You couldn&rsquo;t understand unless you was an old man who had it in him once to do something and be a MAN, and just went and made himself a devilish fool.
