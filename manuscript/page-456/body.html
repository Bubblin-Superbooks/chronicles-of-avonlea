<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Emmeline ungraciously, &ldquo;but Priscilla shall come, too, for I see that she isn&rsquo;t to be trusted out of my sight after this.&rdquo;</p><p>I hoped Stephen would see us from the garret window and make good his escape. But I didn&rsquo;t dare trust to chance, so when I got Emmeline safely to work on my comfort I excused myself and slipped out. Luckily my kitchen was on the off side of the house, but I was a nervous woman as I rushed across to the Strong place and dashed up Emmeline&rsquo;s garret stairs to Stephen. It was fortunate I had come, for he didn&rsquo;t know we had gone. Prissy had hidden him behind the loom and he didn&rsquo;t dare move for fear Emmeline would hear him on that creaky floor. He was a sight with cobwebs.</p></div> </div>
