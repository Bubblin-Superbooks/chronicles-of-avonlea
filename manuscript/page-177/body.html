Mrs. Murphy says she believes the woman is dying, but nobody dares tell her so. She won&rsquo;t give in she&rsquo;s sick, nor take medicine. And there&rsquo;s nobody to wait on her except that simple creature, Maggie Peterson.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wonder if I ought to go and see her,&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard uneasily.</p><p>&ldquo;What use would it be to bother yourself? You know she wouldn&rsquo;t see you&mdash;she&rsquo;d shut the door in your face like she did before. She&rsquo;s an awful wicked woman&mdash;but it&rsquo;s kind of terrible to think of her lying there sick, with no responsible person to tend her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
