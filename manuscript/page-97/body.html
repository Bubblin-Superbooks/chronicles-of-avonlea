<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Sylvia softly, &ldquo;my father was a poet? He published a little volume of verse once; and, Janet, I&rsquo;ve never seen a copy of it, and oh, how I would love to! It was published when he was at college&mdash;just a small, private edition to give his friends. He never published any more&mdash;poor father! I think life disappointed him. But I have such a longing to see that little book of his verse. I haven&rsquo;t a scrap of his writings. If I had it would seem as if I possessed something of him&mdash;of his heart, his soul, his inner life. He would be something more than a mere name to me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
