<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Oh, Jordan, it makes my old heart young again to remember it. A sweet child she was, my little Joscelyn! She used to write me for three or four years after she went away, but I haven&rsquo;t heard a word from her for long and long. I daresay she has forgotten me, as Maria says. &lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be any wonder. But I haven&rsquo;t forgotten her, and oh, I want to see and hear her terrible much. She is to sing at the Old Timers&rsquo; concert to-morrow night at Kensington. The folks who are getting the concert up are friends of hers, or, of course, she&rsquo;d never have come to a little country village. Only sixteen miles away&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
