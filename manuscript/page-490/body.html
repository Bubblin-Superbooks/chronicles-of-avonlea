<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Salome listened in agony. Every word of Lionel Hezekiah&rsquo;s stung her conscience unbearably. So this was the result of her weak yielding to Judith; this innocent child looked upon her as a wicked woman, and, worse still, regarded old, depraved Abel Blair as a model to be imitated. Oh! was it too late to undo the evil? When Judith returned, Salome blurted out the whole story. &ldquo;Lionel Hezekiah must go to Sunday school,&rdquo; she concluded appealingly.</p><p>Judith&rsquo;s face hardened until it was as if cut in stone.</p><p>&ldquo;No, he shall not,&rdquo; she said stubbornly. &ldquo;No one living in my household shall ever go to church or Sunday school. I gave in to you when you wanted to teach him to say his prayers, though I knew it was only foolish superstition, but I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t yield another inch.</p></div> </div>
