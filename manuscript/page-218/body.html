I&rsquo;m not going to be here very long now. No, I&rsquo;m not, Jordan, I know it. Something tells me so very plainly. But I would be willing to go&mdash;glad to go, for I&rsquo;m very tired, Jordan&mdash;if I could only have heard little Joscelyn sing once more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so set on hearing her?&rdquo; asked Jordan. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t no kin to you, is she?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but dearer to me&mdash;dearer to me than many of my own. Maria thinks that is silly, but you wouldn&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;d known her, Jordan. Even Maria herself wouldn&rsquo;t, if she had known her. It is fifteen years since she came here one summer to board.</p></div> </div>
