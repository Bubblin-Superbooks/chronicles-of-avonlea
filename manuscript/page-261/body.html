Lucinda drove over the two miles of hill and dale with a youthful second cousin, by name, Carey Penhallow. The wedding was quite a brilliant affair. Lucinda seemed to pervade the social atmosphere, and everywhere she went a little ripple of admiration trailed after her like a wave. She was undeniably a belle, yet she found herself feeling faintly bored and was rather glad than otherwise when the guests began to fray off.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m losing my capacity for enjoyment,&rdquo; she thought, a little drearily. &ldquo;Yes, I must be growing old. That is what it means when social functions begin to bore you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
