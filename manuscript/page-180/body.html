<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;After the thunder was over it rained a while longer, and Naomi sat down and talked to me. She asked me who I was, and when I told her she asked me to play something for her on her violin,&rdquo;&mdash;Felix shot a deprecating glance at Mr. Leonard&mdash;&ldquo;because, she said, she&rsquo;d heard I was a great hand at it. She wanted something lively, and I tried just as hard as I could to play something like that. But I couldn&rsquo;t. I played something that was terrible&mdash;it just played itself&mdash;it seemed as if something was lost that could never be found again. And before I got through, Naomi came at me, and tore the violin from me, and&mdash;SWORE. And she said, &lsquo;You big-eyed brat, how did you know THAT?&rsquo; Then she took me by the arm&mdash;and she hurt me, too, I can tell you&mdash;and she put me right out in the rain and slammed the door.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
