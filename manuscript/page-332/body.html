<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. Malcolm MacPherson could never be trained to old-maidishness, and even Aunt Olivia seemed to realize this. He never stopped to clear his boots when he came in, although she had an ostentatiously new scraper put at each door for his benefit. He seldom moved in the house without knocking some of Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s treasures over. He smoked cigars in her parlour and scattered the ashes over the floor. He brought her flowers every day and stuck them into whatever receptacle came handiest. He sat on her cushions and rolled her antimacassars up into balls. He put his feet on her chair rungs&mdash;and all with the most distracting unconsciousness of doing anything out of the way. He never noticed Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s fluttering nervousness at all. Peggy and I laughed more than was good for us those days.</p></div> </div>
