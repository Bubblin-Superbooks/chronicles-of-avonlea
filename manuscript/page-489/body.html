<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;your Aunt Judith won&rsquo;t let me go,&rdquo; faltered Salome, more perplexed than she had ever been before in her life.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that you have much fun on Sundays,&rdquo; remarked Lionel Hezekiah ponderingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have more if I was you. But I s&rsquo;pose you can&rsquo;t &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re ladies. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m a man. Look at Abel Blair, what splendid times he has on Sundays. He never goes to church, but he goes fishing, and has cock-fights, and gets drunk. When I grow up, I&rsquo;m going to do that on Sundays too, since I won&rsquo;t be going to church. I don&rsquo;t want to go to church, but I&rsquo;d like to go to Sunday school.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
