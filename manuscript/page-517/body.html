That was just how you used to say &lsquo;Nancy&rsquo; long ago, as if I&rsquo;d broken all the commandments at once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do say such queer things,&rdquo; protested Louisa, &ldquo;and half the time I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bless you, dear coz, half the time I don&rsquo;t myself. Perhaps the joy of coming back to the old spot has slightly turned my brain, I&rsquo;ve found my lost girlhood here. I&rsquo;m NOT thirty-eight in this garden&mdash;it is a flat impossibility. I&rsquo;m sweet eighteen, with a waist line two inches smaller. Look, the sun is just setting. I see he has still his old trick of throwing his last beams over the Wright farmhouse. By the way, Louisa, is Peter Wright still living there?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
