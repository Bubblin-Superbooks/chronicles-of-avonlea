Would that I had been born with that blessed faculty of never noticing! It stands a woman in better stead than beauty or brains. I used to notice Peter&rsquo;s mistakes. When he said &lsquo;I seen,&rsquo; it jarred on me in my salad days. I tried, oh, so tactfully, to reform him in that respect. Peter didn&rsquo;t like being reformed&mdash;the Wrights always had a fairly good opinion of themselves, you know. It was really over a question of syntax we quarrelled. Peter told me I&rsquo;d have to take him as he was, grammar and all, or go without him.</p></div> </div>
