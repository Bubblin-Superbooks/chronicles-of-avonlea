She is a famous woman, and she has forgotten all about you, you can be sure of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Joscelyn wasn&rsquo;t the kind that forgets,&rdquo; said Aunty Nan loyally. &ldquo;And, anyway, the point is, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten HER. Oh, Maria, I&rsquo;ve longed for years and years just to hear her sing once more. It seems as if I MUST hear my little Joscelyn sing once again before I die. I&rsquo;ve never had the chance before and I never will have it again. Do please ask William to take me to Kensington.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
