She would not waken her, but she took from her breast the cluster of crimson roses she wore and slipped them gently between the toil-worn fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-bye, dear, sweet mother-heart,&rdquo; she murmured.</p><p>Down-stairs she met Mrs. William splendid in rustling black silk, her broad, rubicund face smiling, overflowing with apologies and welcomes, which Joscelyn cut short coldly.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Morrison, but I cannot possibly stay longer. No, thank you, I don&rsquo;t care for any refreshments. Jordan is going to take me back to Kensington at once. I came out to see Aunty Nan.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain she&rsquo;d be delighted,&rdquo; said Mrs. William effusively. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been talking about you for weeks.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
