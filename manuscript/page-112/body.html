But you see, these so-called scholarships are private affairs, dependent solely on the whim and choice of Andrew Cameron himself. Of course, when a girl has friends who use their influence with him, he will often send her on their recommendation. They say he sent a girl last year who hadn&rsquo;t much of a voice at all just because her father had been an old business crony of his. But Sylvia doesn&rsquo;t know anyone at all who would, to use a slang term, have any &lsquo;pull&rsquo; with Andrew Cameron, and she is not acquainted with him herself. Well, I must be going; we&rsquo;ll see you at the Manse on Saturday, I hope, Miss Lloyd. The Circle meets there, you know.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
