John Clarke lived at White Sands and he and his wife were childless.</p><p>That bid of John Clarke&rsquo;s was Pa&rsquo;s undoing. Pa Sloane could not have an enemy; but a rival he had, and that rival was John Clarke. Everywhere at auctions John Clarke was wont to bid against Pa. At the last auction he had outbid Pa in everything, not having the fear of his wife before his eyes. Pa&rsquo;s fighting blood was up in a moment; he forgot Ma Sloane; he forgot what he was bidding for; he forgot everything except a determination that John Clarke should not be victor again.</p></div> </div>
