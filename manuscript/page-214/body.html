You aren&rsquo;t strong enough to drive to Kensington, and, even if you were, you know well enough that William couldn&rsquo;t go to Kensington to-morrow night. He has got to attend that political meeting at Newbridge. They can&rsquo;t do without him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jordan could take me to Kensington,&rdquo; pleaded Aunty Nan, with very unusual persistence.</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You couldn&rsquo;t go to Kensington with the hired man. Now, Aunty Nan, do be reasonable. Aren&rsquo;t William and I kind to you? Don&rsquo;t we do everything for your comfort?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
