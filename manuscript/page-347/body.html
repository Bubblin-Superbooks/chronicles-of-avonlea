<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One evening father came home with some news. &ldquo;Malcolm MacPherson is leaving on the 7:30 train for the west,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has rented the Avonlea place and he&rsquo;s off. They say he is mad as a hatter at the trick Olivia played on him.&rdquo;</p><p>After tea Peggy and I went over to see Aunt Olivia, who had asked our advice about a wrapper. She was sewing as for dear life, and her face was primmer and colder than ever. I wondered if she knew of Mr. Malcolm MacPherson&rsquo;s departure. Delicacy forbade me to mention it but Peggy had no such scruples.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Aunt Olivia, your beau is off,&rdquo; she announced cheerfully. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be bothered with him again. He is leaving on the mail train for the west.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
