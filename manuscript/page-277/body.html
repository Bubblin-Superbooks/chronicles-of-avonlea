<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Day after to-morrow&mdash;day after to-morrow,&rdquo; said Old Man Shaw, rubbing his long slender hands together gleefully. &ldquo;I have to keep saying it over and over, so as to really believe it. It seems far too good to be true that I&rsquo;m to have Blossom again. And everything is ready. Yes, I think everything is ready, except a bit of cooking. And won&rsquo;t this orchard be a surprise to her! I&rsquo;m just going to bring her out here as soon as I can, never saying a word. I&rsquo;ll fetch her through the spruce lane, and when we come to the end of the path I&rsquo;ll step back casual-like, and let her go out from under the trees alone, never suspecting.</p></div> </div>
