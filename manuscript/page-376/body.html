This house is under quarantine for smallpox. You will have to stay here.&rdquo;</p><p>Smallpox! For the first and last time in my life, I openly lost my temper with a man. I wheeled furiously upon Alexander Abraham.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; I cried.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell you!&rdquo; he said, glaring at me. &ldquo;When I first saw you it was too late to tell you.
