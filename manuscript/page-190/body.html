He had seen sad death-beds&mdash;troubled death-beds&mdash;ay, and despairing death-beds, but never anything like this. &ldquo;God!&rdquo; Naomi&rsquo;s voice shrilled terribly as she uttered the name. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to God for help. Oh, I&rsquo;m skeered of hell, but I&rsquo;m skeereder still of God. I&rsquo;d rather go to hell a thousand times over than face God after the life I&rsquo;ve lived. I tell you, I&rsquo;m sorry for living wicked&mdash;I was always sorry for it all the time. There ain&rsquo;t never been a moment I wasn&rsquo;t sorry, though nobody would believe it. I was driven on by fiends of hell. Oh, you don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;you CAN&rsquo;T understand&mdash;but I was always sorry!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
