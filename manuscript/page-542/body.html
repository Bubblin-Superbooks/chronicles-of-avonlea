I guess them mistakes are past kerrecting in an old fellow like me. Worse mistakes, Nancy. I wonder what you would say if I asked you to forgive me, and have me after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d snap you up before you&rsquo;d have time to change your mind,&rdquo; said Nancy brazenly. She tried to look Peter in the face, but her blue eyes, where tears and mirth were blending, faltered down before his gray ones.</p></div> </div>
