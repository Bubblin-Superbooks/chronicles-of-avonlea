<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Lo! this summer had flung the hoarded sweetness of years into plentiful white blossoms, like shallow ivory cups with a haunting, spicy fragrance. It was in honour of Sara&rsquo;s home-coming&mdash;so Old Man Shaw liked to fancy. All things, even the sulky rose-bush, knew she was coming back, and were making glad because of it.</p><p>He was gloating over Sara&rsquo;s letter when Mrs. Peter Blewett came. She told him she had run up to see how he was getting on, and if he wanted anything seen to before Sara came.</p><p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m, thank you, ma&rsquo;am. Everything is attended to. I couldn&rsquo;t let anyone else prepare for Blossom. Only to think, ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;ll be home the day after to-morrow. I&rsquo;m just filled clear through, body, soul, and spirit, with joy to think of having my little Blossom at home again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
