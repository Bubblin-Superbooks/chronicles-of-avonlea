<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Felix, I forgive you, but I ask you to promise me, here and now, that you will never again, as long as you live, touch a violin.&rdquo; Dusky crimson rushed madly over the boy&rsquo;s face. He gave a cry as if he had been lashed with a whip. Old Abel sprang to his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ask such a promise of him, Mr. Leonard,&rdquo; he cried furiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sin, that&rsquo;s what it is. Man, man, what blinds you? You ARE blind. Can&rsquo;t you see what is in the boy? His soul is full of music. It&rsquo;ll torture him to death&mdash;or to worse&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t let it have way.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
