Yes, HE could understand and forgive. He was half human. I tell you, it&rsquo;s God I&rsquo;m skeered of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are one and the same,&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard helplessly. He knew he could not make Naomi realize it. This anguished death-bed was no place for a theological exposition on the mysteries of the Trinity.</p><p>&ldquo;Christ died for you, Naomi. He bore your sins in His own body on the cross.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We bear our own sins,&rdquo; said Naomi fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve borne mine all my life&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll bear them for all eternity. I can&rsquo;t believe anything else. I CAN&rsquo;T believe God can forgive me.</p></div> </div>
