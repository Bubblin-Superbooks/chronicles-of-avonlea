She is the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Bromley, of The Beeches.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now if I can get there in time,&rdquo; said Jordan emphatically.</p><p>Jordan got to Kensington, put Dan up in a livery stable, and inquired the way to The Beeches. He felt rather nervous when he found it, it was such a stately, imposing place, set back from the street in an emerald green seclusion of beautiful grounds.</p><p>&ldquo;Fancy me stalking up to that front door and asking for Miss Joscelyn Burnett,&rdquo; grinned Jordan sheepishly. &ldquo;Mebbe they&rsquo;ll tell me to go around to the back and inquire for the cook. But you&rsquo;re going just the same, Jordan Sloane, and no skulking. March right up now. Think of Aunty Nan and don&rsquo;t let style down you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
