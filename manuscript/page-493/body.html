I&rsquo;ll not take him; I won&rsquo;t go against you in that, for it is your bounty feeds and clothes him; but I&rsquo;m going myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you do, Salome Marsh, I&rsquo;ll never forgive you,&rdquo; said Judith, her harsh face dark with anger; and then, not trusting herself to discuss the subject any longer, she went out.</p><p>Salome dissolved into her ready tears, and cried most of the night. But her resolution did not fail. Go to church she would, for that dear baby&rsquo;s sake.</p></div> </div>
