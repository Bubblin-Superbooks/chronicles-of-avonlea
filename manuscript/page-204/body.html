<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Felix lowered the violin and dropped wearily on a chair by the bed. The inspired light faded from his face; once more he was only a tired boy. But Stephen Leonard was on his knees, sobbing like a child; and Naomi Clark was lying still, with her hands clasped over her breast.</p><p>&ldquo;I understand now,&rdquo; she said very softly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see it before&mdash;and now it&rsquo;s so plain. I just FEEL it. God IS a God of love. He can forgive anybody&mdash;even me&mdash;even me. He knows all about it. I ain&rsquo;t skeered any more. He just loves me and forgives me as I&rsquo;d have loved and forgiven my baby if she&rsquo;d lived, no matter how bad she was, or what she did. The minister told me that but I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I KNOW it now. And He sent you here to-night, boy, to tell it to me in a way that I could feel it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
