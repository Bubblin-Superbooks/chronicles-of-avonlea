<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I. The May Chapter</p><p>Spencervale gossip always said that &ldquo;Old Lady Lloyd&rdquo; was rich and mean and proud. Gossip, as usual, was one-third right and two-thirds wrong. Old Lady Lloyd was neither rich nor mean; in reality she was pitifully poor&mdash;so poor that &ldquo;Crooked Jack&rdquo; Spencer, who dug her garden and chopped her wood for her, was opulent by contrast, for he, at least, never lacked three meals a day, and the Old Lady could sometimes achieve no more than one. But she WAS very proud&mdash;so proud that she would have died rather than let the Spencervale people, among whom she had queened it in her youth, suspect how poor she was and to what straits was sometimes reduced. She much preferred to have them think her miserly and odd&mdash;a queer old recluse who never went anywhere, even to church, and who paid the smallest subscription to the minister&rsquo;s salary of anyone in the congregation.</p></div> </div>
