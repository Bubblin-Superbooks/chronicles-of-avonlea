<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Very well, doctor,&rdquo; I said calmly. &ldquo;Yes, I was vaccinated a month ago, when the news of the smallpox first came. When you go back through Avonlea kindly go to Sarah Pye and ask her to live in my house during my absence and look after things, especially the cats. Tell her to give them new milk twice a day and a square inch of butter apiece once a week. Get her to put my two dark print wrappers, some aprons, and some changes of underclothing in my third best valise and have it sent down to me. My pony is tied out there to the fence. Please take him home. That is all, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham grumpily. &ldquo;Send that cat home, too. I won&rsquo;t have a cat around the place&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather have smallpox.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
