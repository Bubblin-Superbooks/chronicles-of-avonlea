I suppose he has cried himself to sleep, poor, dear baby. He certainly is dreadfully mischievous; but it seems to me that it shows an investigating turn of mind, and if it could only be directed into the proper channels&mdash;I wish Judith would let me have a talk with Mr. Leonard about Lionel Hezekiah. I wish Judith didn&rsquo;t hate ministers so. I don&rsquo;t mind so much her not letting me go to church, because I&rsquo;m so lame that it would be painful anyhow; but I&rsquo;d like to talk with Mr. Leonard now and then about some things. I can never believe that Judith and father were right; I am sure they were not. There is a God, and I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s terribly wicked not to go to church.</p></div> </div>
