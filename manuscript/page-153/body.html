<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I happened to say about something that it didn&rsquo;t matter to a battered old hulk of sixty odd like me. She looked at me with her big, innocent eyes, a little reproachful like, as if I&rsquo;d said something awful heretical. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Mr. Blair,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;that the older we get the more things ought to matter to us?&rsquo;&mdash;as grave as if she&rsquo;d been a hundred instead of eleven. &lsquo;Things matter SO much to me now,&rsquo; she says, clasping her hands thisaway, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m sure that when I&rsquo;m sixty they&rsquo;ll matter just five times as much to me.&rsquo; Well, the way she looked and the way she spoke made me feel downright ashamed of myself because things had stopped mattering with me. But never mind all that. My miserable old feelings don&rsquo;t count for much. What come of your father&rsquo;s fiddle?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
