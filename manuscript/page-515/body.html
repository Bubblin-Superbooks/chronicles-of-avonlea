Every morning when I get up I have to say solemnly to myself three times, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re an old maid, Nancy Rogerson,&rsquo; to tone myself down to anything like a becoming attitude for the day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you don&rsquo;t mind being an old maid much,&rdquo; said Louisa, shrugging her shoulders.
