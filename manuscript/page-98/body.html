She died when I was born, you know, but Aunty says there was no copy of father&rsquo;s poems among mother&rsquo;s books. Mother didn&rsquo;t care for poetry, Aunty says&mdash;Aunty doesn&rsquo;t either. Father went to Europe after mother died, and he died there the next year. Nothing that he had with him was ever sent home to us. He had sold most of his books before he went, but he gave a few of his favourite ones to Aunty to keep for me. HIS book wasn&rsquo;t among them. I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall ever find a copy, but I should be so delighted if I only could.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
