When she asked Sylvia how she liked living in Spencervale, Sylvia said,</p><p>&ldquo;Very much. Everybody is so kind to me. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;Sylvia lowered her voice so that nobody but the Old Lady could hear it&mdash;&ldquo;I have a fairy godmother here who does the most beautiful and wonderful things for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Sylvia, being a girl of fine instincts, did not look at Old Lady Lloyd as she said this.
