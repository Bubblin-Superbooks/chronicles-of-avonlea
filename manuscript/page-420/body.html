<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a baby for sale,&rdquo; shouted the auctioneer. &ldquo;A genuine article, pretty near as good as brand-new. A real live baby, warranted to walk and talk a little. Who bids? A dollar? Did I hear anyone mean enough to bid a dollar? No, sir, babies don&rsquo;t come as cheap as that, especially the curly-headed brand.&rdquo;</p><p>The crowd laughed again. Pa Sloane, by way of keeping on the joke, cried, &ldquo;Four dollars!&rdquo;</p><p>Everybody looked at him. The impression flashed through the crowd that Pa was in earnest, and meant thus to signify his intention of giving the baby a home. He was well-to-do, and his only son was grown up and married.</p></div> </div>
