Judith was the first to speak. She pushed through the crowd to Salome. Her face was blanched to a deadly whiteness; and her eyes, as Mrs. William Blair afterwards declared, were enough to give a body the creeps.</p><p>&ldquo;Salome,&rdquo; she said in a high, shrill, unnatural voice, &ldquo;where is your crutch?&rdquo;</p><p>Salome came to herself at the question.
