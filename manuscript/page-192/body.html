<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Naomi, God loves us like a father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like MY father?&rdquo; Naomi&rsquo;s shrill laughter, pealing through the still room, was hideous to hear.</p><p>The old minister shuddered.</p><p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no! As a kind, tender, all-wise father, Naomi&mdash;as you would have loved your little child if it had lived.&rdquo;</p><p>Naomi cowered and moaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish I could believe THAT. I wouldn&rsquo;t be frightened if I could believe that. MAKE me believe it. Surely you can make me believe that there&rsquo;s love and forgiveness in God if you believe it yourself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
