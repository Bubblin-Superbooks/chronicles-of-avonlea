All my old chums are gone, or hopelessly married and changed, and the young set who have come up know not Joseph, and make me feel uncomfortably middle-aged. It&rsquo;s far worse to feel middle-aged than old, you know. Away there in the woods I feel as eternally young as Nature herself. And oh, it&rsquo;s so nice not having to fuss with thermometers and temperatures and other people&rsquo;s whims. Let me indulge my own whims, Louisa dear, and punish me with a cold bite when I come in late for meals. I&rsquo;m not even going to church again. It was horrible there yesterday. The church is so offensively spick-and-span brand new and modern.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
