The child was just starving for love, Jordan, and she got it here. William and his brothers were just children then, and they hadn&rsquo;t any sister. We all just worshipped her. She was so sweet, Jordan. And pretty, oh my! like a little girl in a picture, with great long curls, all black and purply and fine as spun silk, and big dark eyes, and such pink cheeks&mdash;real wild rose cheeks. And sing! My land! But couldn&rsquo;t she sing! Always singing, every hour of the day that voice was ringing round the old place. I used to hold my breath to hear it. She always said that she meant to be a famous singer some day, and I never doubted it a mite. It was born in her. Sunday evening she used to sing hymns for us.</p></div> </div>
