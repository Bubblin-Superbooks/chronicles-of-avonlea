<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Emmeline took after her father; she was big and dark and homely, and she was the most domineering creature that ever stepped on shoe leather. She simply ruled poor Prissy with a rod of iron.</p><p>Prissy herself was a pretty girl&mdash;at least most people thought so. I can&rsquo;t honestly say I ever admired her style much myself. I like something with more vim and snap to it. Prissy was slim and pink, with soft, appealing blue eyes, and pale gold hair all clinging in baby rings around her face. She was just as meek and timid as she looked and there wasn&rsquo;t a bit of harm in her. I always liked Prissy, even if I didn&rsquo;t admire her looks as much as some people did.</p></div> </div>
