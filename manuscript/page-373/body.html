<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I wondered if Alexander Abraham thought I would go away with a whoop. But I said nothing, thinking this the most dignified course of conduct, and I followed him out to the kitchen as quickly and quietly as he could have wished. Such a kitchen!</p><p>Alexander Abraham opened the door&mdash;which was locked&mdash;just as a buggy containing two men drove into the yard.</p><p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a tragic tone. I understood that something dreadful must have happened, but I did not care, since, as I fondly supposed, it did not concern me. I pushed out past Alexander Abraham&mdash;who was looking as guilty as if he had been caught burglarizing&mdash;and came face to face with the man who had sprung from the buggy. It was old Dr. Blair, from Carmody, and he was looking at me as if he had found me shoplifting.</p></div> </div>
