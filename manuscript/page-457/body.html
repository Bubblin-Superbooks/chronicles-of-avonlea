Emmeline began to rage at Prissy the moment they were outside my door.</p><p>Then Stephen came in and we talked things over. He and Prissy had made good use of their time, short as it had been. Prissy had promised to marry him, and all that remained was to get the ceremony performed.</p><p>&ldquo;And that will be no easy matter,&rdquo; I warned him. &ldquo;Now that Emmeline&rsquo;s suspicions are aroused she&rsquo;ll never let Prissy out of her sight until you&rsquo;re married to another woman, if it&rsquo;s years. I know Emmeline Strong. And I know Prissy. If it was any other girl in the world she&rsquo;d run away, or manage it somehow, but Prissy never will. She&rsquo;s too much in the habit of obeying Emmeline. You&rsquo;ll have an obedient wife, Stephen&mdash;if you ever get her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
