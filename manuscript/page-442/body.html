<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nobody ever tried to go with Prissy again. I suppose they were afraid of Emmeline. Prissy&rsquo;s beauty soon faded. She was always kind of sweet looking, but her bloom went, and she got shyer and limper every year of her life. She wouldn&rsquo;t have dared put on her second best dress without asking Emmeline&rsquo;s permission. She was real fond of cats and Emmeline wouldn&rsquo;t let her keep one. Emmeline even cut the serial out of the religious weekly she took before she would give it to Prissy, because she didn&rsquo;t believe in reading novels. It used to make me furious to see it all. They were my next door neighbours after I married Thomas, and I was often in and out. Sometimes I&rsquo;d feel real vexed at Prissy for giving in the way she did; but, after all, she couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;she was born that way.</p></div> </div>
