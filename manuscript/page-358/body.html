<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What class do you want me to teach?&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Allan was so surprised that she forgot to be tactful, and answered plainly for once in her life,</p><p>&ldquo;There are two classes&mdash;one of boys and one of girls&mdash;needing a teacher. I have been teaching the girls&rsquo; class, but I shall have to give it up for a little time on account of the baby&rsquo;s health. You may have your choice, Miss MacPherson.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I shall take the boys,&rdquo; I said decidedly. I am noted for my decision. &ldquo;Since they have to grow up to be men it&rsquo;s well to train them properly betimes. Nuisances they are bound to become under any circumstances; but if they are taken in hand young enough they may not grow up to be such nuisances as they otherwise would and that will be some unfortunate woman&rsquo;s gain.&rdquo; Mrs. Allan looked dubious. I knew she had expected me to choose the girls.</p></div> </div>
