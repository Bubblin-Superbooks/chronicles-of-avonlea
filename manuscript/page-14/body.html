But even Anne&rsquo;s imagination failed her for this.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she thought, impatiently, &ldquo;if I wanted him I think I&rsquo;d find some way of hurrying him up. Ludovic SPEED! Was there ever such a misfit of a name? Such a name for such a man is a delusion and a snare.&rdquo;</p><p>Presently Ludovic got to the house, but stood so long on the doorstep in a brown study, gazing into the tangled green boskage of the cherry orchard, that Theodora finally went and opened the door before he knocked. As she brought him into the sitting-room she made a comical grimace at Anne over his shoulder.</p></div> </div>
