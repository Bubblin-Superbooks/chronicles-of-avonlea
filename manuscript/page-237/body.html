Do you remember when you were here how we sung hymns in the parlour every Sunday night, and my favourite always was &lsquo;The Sands of Time are Sinking?&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t never forgot how you used to sing that, and I want to hear it just once again, dearie. Sing it for me, little Joscelyn.&rdquo;</p><p>Joscelyn rose and went to the window. Lifting back the curtain, she stood in the splendour of the moonlight, and sang the grand old hymn. At first Aunty Nan beat time to it feebly on the counterpane; but when Joscelyn came to the verse, &ldquo;With mercy and with judgment,&rdquo; she folded her hands over her breast and smiled.</p></div> </div>
