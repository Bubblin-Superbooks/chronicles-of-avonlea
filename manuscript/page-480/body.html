<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too young to go to school. Father always said that no child should go to school until it was seven, and I don&rsquo;t mean Lionel Hezekiah shall. Well, I&rsquo;m going to take a pail of hot water and a brush, and see what I can do to that henhouse door. I&rsquo;ve got my afternoon&rsquo;s work cut out for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Judith stood Salome&rsquo;s crutch up beside her, and departed to purify the henhouse door. As soon as she was safely out of the way, Salome took her crutch, and limped slowly and painfully to the foot of the stairs. She could not go up and comfort Lionel Hezekiah as she yearned to do, which was the reason Judith had sent him up-stairs. Salome had not been up-stairs for fifteen years. Neither did she dare to call him out on the landing, lest Judith return. Besides, of course he must be punished; he had been very naughty.</p></div> </div>
