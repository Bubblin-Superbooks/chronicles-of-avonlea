<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Old Abel is amusing himself with his violin again,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;What a delicious thing he is playing! He has quite a gift for the violin. But how can he play such a thing as that,&mdash;a battered old hulk of a man who has, at one time or another, wallowed in almost every sin to which human nature can sink? He was on one of his sprees three days ago&mdash;the first one for over a year&mdash;lying dead-drunk in the market square in Charlottetown among the dogs; and now he is playing something that only a young archangel on the hills of heaven ought to be able to play. Well, it will make my task all the easier. Abel is always repentant by the time he is able to play on his fiddle.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
