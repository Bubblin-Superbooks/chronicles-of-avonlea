<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, Emmeline made me,&rdquo; said Prissy, as if there couldn&rsquo;t be any appeal from that; and I knew there couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;for Prissy. I also knew that if Stephen wanted to see Prissy again Emmeline must know nothing of it, and I told him so when he came down the next evening&mdash;to borrow a hoe, he said. It was a long way to come for a hoe.</p><p>&ldquo;Then what am I to do?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be any use to write, for it would likely fall into Emmeline&rsquo;s hands. She won&rsquo;t let Prissy go anywhere alone after this, and how am I to know when the old cat is away?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
