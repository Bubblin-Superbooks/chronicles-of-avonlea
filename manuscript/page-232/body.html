<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For the moment Joscelyn Burnett was a lonely, hungry-hearted little girl again, seeking for love and finding it not, until Aunty Nan had taken her into her great mother-heart and taught her its meaning.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said perplexedly. &ldquo;If you had come sooner&mdash;I leave on the 11:30 train tonight. I MUST leave by then or I shall not reach Montreal in time to fill a very important engagement. And yet I must see Aunty Nan, too. I have been careless and neglectful. I might have gone to see her before. How can we manage it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you back to Kensington in time to catch that train,&rdquo; said Jordan eagerly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I wouldn&rsquo;t do for Aunty Nan&mdash;me and Dan. Yes, sir, you&rsquo;ll get back in time. Just think of Aunty Nan&rsquo;s face when she sees you!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
