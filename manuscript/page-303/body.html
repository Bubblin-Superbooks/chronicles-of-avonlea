You didn&rsquo;t have to walk from the station, did you? And your old daddy not there to welcome you!&rdquo;</p><p>Sara laughed, swung herself back by the tips of her fingers and danced around him in the childish fashion of long ago.</p><p>&ldquo;I found I could make an earlier connection with the C.P.A. yesterday and get to the Island last night. I was in such a fever to get home that I jumped at the chance. Of course I walked from the station&mdash;it&rsquo;s only two miles and every step was a benediction. My trunks are over there.</p></div> </div>
