With a shame-faced laugh, she held out her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have me arrested for trespass, Peter. I came and looked in at your kitchen out of impertinent curiosity, and just for fun I thought I&rsquo;d come in and get your tea. I thought you&rsquo;d be so surprised&mdash;and I meant to go before you came home, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised,&rdquo; said Peter, shaking hands. &ldquo;I saw you go past the field and I tied the horses and followed you down through the woods. I&rsquo;ve been sitting on the fence back yonder, watching your comings and goings.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come and speak to me at church yesterday, Peter?&rdquo; demanded Nancy boldly.</p></div> </div>
