The place was not in view of any other near house. She deliberately went up to it intending&mdash;low be it spoken&mdash;to peep in at the kitchen window. But, seeing the door wide open, she went to it instead and halted on the step, looking about her keenly.</p><p>The kitchen was certainly pitiful in its disorder. The floor had apparently not been swept for a fortnight. On the bare deal table were the remnants of Peter&rsquo;s dinner, a meal that could not have been very tempting at its best.</p><p>&ldquo;What a miserable place for a human being to live in!&rdquo; groaned Nancy. &ldquo;Look at the ashes on that stove! And that table! Is it any wonder that Peter has got gray? He&rsquo;ll work hard haymaking all the afternoon&mdash;and then come home to THIS!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
