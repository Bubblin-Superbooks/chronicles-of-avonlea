Mr. MacPherson is a splendid man, but Aunt Olivia is a born old maid, and it is outraging her very nature to be anything else. Don&rsquo;t you see how it&rsquo;s hurting her? His big, splendid man-ways are harrowing her very soul up&mdash;she can&rsquo;t get out of her little, narrow groove, and it is killing her to be pulled out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Peggy. Then she added with a laugh,</p><p>&ldquo;Mary, did you ever see anything so funny as Aunt Olivia sitting on &lsquo;Mr. Malcolm MacPherson&rsquo;s&rsquo; knee?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
