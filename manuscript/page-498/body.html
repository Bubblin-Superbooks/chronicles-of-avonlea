But he had not been wicked; he had been good and kind in his own odd way.</p><p>The gentle little mother had died when Salome was ten years old, but so loving and tender was Judith&rsquo;s care that the child did not miss anything out of her life. Judith Marsh loved her little sister with an intensity that was maternal. She herself was a plain, repellent girl, liked by few, sought after by no man; but she was determined that Salome should have everything that she had missed&mdash;admiration, friendship, love. She would have a vicarious youth in Salome&rsquo;s.</p></div> </div>
