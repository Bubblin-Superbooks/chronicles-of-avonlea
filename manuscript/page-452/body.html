<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, Em&rsquo;line&rsquo;s gone to sit up with Jane Lawson to-night,&rdquo; said Prissy, all fluttered and trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;Then you put on your muslin dress and fix your hair,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home to get Thomas to tie something to that ventilator.&rdquo;</p><p>But do you think Thomas would do it? Not he. He said he owed something to his position as elder in the church. In the end I had to do it myself, though I don&rsquo;t like climbing ladders. I tied Thomas&rsquo; long red woollen scarf to the ventilator, and prayed that Stephen would see it. He did, for in less than an hour he drove down our lane and put his horse in our barn. He was all spruced up, and as nervous and excited as a schoolboy. He went right over to Prissy, and I began to tuft my new comfort with a clear conscience.</p></div> </div>
