Now, it is impossible to go down. Is it, then, William Adolphus, possible to go up?&rdquo;</p><p>I looked up. Just above my head was an open window with a tolerably stout branch extending right across it.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we try that way, William Adolphus?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>William Adolphus, wasting no words, began to climb the tree. I followed his example. The dog ran in circles about the tree and looked things not lawful to be uttered.
