<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One night, when prayer meeting came out, Stephen stepped up to Prissy as usual and asked if he might see her home. Thomas and I were just behind&mdash;we weren&rsquo;t married ourselves then&mdash;and we heard it all. Prissy gave one scared, appealing look at Emmeline and then said, &ldquo;No, thank you, not to-night.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen just turned on his heel and went. He was a high-spirited fellow and I knew he would never overlook a public slight like that. If he had had as much sense as he ought to have had he would have known that Emmeline was at the bottom of it; but he didn&rsquo;t, and he began going to see Althea Gillis, and they were married the next year. Althea was a rather nice girl, though giddy, and I think she and Stephen were happy enough together. In real life things are often like that.</p></div> </div>
