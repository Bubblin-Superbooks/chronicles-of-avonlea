<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The marriage of a Penhallow was always the signal for a gathering of the Penhallows. From the uttermost parts of the earth they would come&mdash;Penhallows by birth, and Penhallows by marriage and Penhallows by ancestry. East Grafton was the ancient habitat of the race, and Penhallow Grange, where &ldquo;old&rdquo; John Penhallow lived, was a Mecca to them.</p><p>As for the family itself, the exact kinship of all its various branches and ramifications was a hard thing to define. Old Uncle Julius Penhallow was looked upon as a veritable wonder because he carried it all in his head and could tell on sight just what relation any one Penhallow was to any other Penhallow. The rest made a blind guess at it, for the most part, and the younger Penhallows let it go at loose cousinship.</p></div> </div>
