<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Peggy and I were up in the south-west room at dusk that evening, piecing a quilt, when we heard Mr. Malcolm MacPherson shouting out in the hall below to know if anyone was home. I ran out to the landing, but as I did so Aunt Olivia came out of her room, brushed past me, and flitted downstairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. MacPherson,&rdquo; I heard her say with double-distilled primness, &ldquo;will you please come into the parlour? I have something to say to you.&rdquo;</p><p>They went in, and I returned to the south-west room.</p><p>&ldquo;Peg, there&rsquo;s trouble brewing,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it by Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s face, it was GRAY. And she has gone down ALONE&mdash;and shut the door.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
