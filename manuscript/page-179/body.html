I went to Naomi&rsquo;s house for shelter. The door was open, so I walked right in, because nobody answered my knock. Naomi Clark was at the window, watching the cloud coming up over the sea. She just looked at me once, but didn&rsquo;t say anything, and then went on watching the cloud. I didn&rsquo;t like to sit down because she hadn&rsquo;t asked me to, so I went to the window by her and watched it, too. It was a dreadful sight&mdash;the cloud was so black and the water so green, and there was such a strange light between the cloud and the water; yet there was something splendid in it, too. Part of the time I watched the storm, and the other part I watched Naomi&rsquo;s face. It was dreadful to see, like the storm, and yet I liked to see it.</p></div> </div>
