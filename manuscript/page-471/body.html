Dear me, I am sometimes tempted to think that Judith and I made a mistake in adopting the child. I suppose two old maids don&rsquo;t know much about bringing up a boy properly. But he is NOT a bad child, and it really seems to me that there must be some way of making him behave better if we only knew what it was.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
