He hasn&rsquo;t referred to the matter for years, but I presume that he is of the same mind still. And they are just as much in love with each other as they ever were. He&rsquo;s always hanging about where she is&mdash;when other people are there, too, that is. He avoids her like a plague when she is alone. That was why he was stuck out in the blue room with us to-day. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a particle of resentment between them. If Lucinda would only speak! But that Lucinda will not do.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
