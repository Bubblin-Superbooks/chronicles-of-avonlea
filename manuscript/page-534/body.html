Then she laughed and glanced at her watch.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;just for fun and a little pity. It&rsquo;s half-past two, and Peter won&rsquo;t be home till four at the earliest. I&rsquo;ll have a good hour to do it in, and still make my escape in good time. Nobody will ever know; nobody can see me here.&rdquo;</p><p>Nancy went in, threw off her hat, and seized a broom. The first thing she did was to give the kitchen a thorough sweeping. Then she kindled a fire, put a kettle full of water on to heat, and attacked the dishes. From the number of them she rightly concluded that Peter hadn&rsquo;t washed any for at least a week.</p></div> </div>
