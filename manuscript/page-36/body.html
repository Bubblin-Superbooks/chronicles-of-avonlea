<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, it is really settled at last, Anne. Coming home last night Ludovic asked me plump and plain to marry him,&mdash;Sunday and all as it was. It&rsquo;s to be right away&mdash;for Ludovic won&rsquo;t be put off a week longer than necessary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So Ludovic Speed has been hurried up to some purpose at last,&rdquo; said Mr. Sherman, when Anne called in at Echo Lodge, brimful with her news. &ldquo;And you are delighted, of course, and my poor pride must be the scapegoat. I shall always be remembered in Grafton as the man from Boston who wanted Theodora Dix and couldn&rsquo;t get her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that won&rsquo;t be true, you know,&rdquo; said Anne comfortingly.</p></div> </div>
