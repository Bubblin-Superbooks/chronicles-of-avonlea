Father laughed at the whole thing, but I could not laugh. I was sorry for Mr. Malcolm MacPherson and, though I was angry with her, I was sorry for Aunt Olivia, too. Plainly she felt badly enough over her vanished hopes and plans, but she had developed a strange and baffling reserve which nothing could pierce.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but a chronic case of old-maidism,&rdquo; said father impatiently.</p><p>Things were very dull for a week.
