He was a terrible old man to swear, too,&rdquo; added Mrs. Frederick, dropping into irrelevant reminiscence. &ldquo;He spent a long while in a mining camp in his younger days and he never got over it&mdash;the habit of swearing, I mean. It would have made your blood run cold, my dear, to have heard him go on at times. And yet he was a real good old man every other way.</p></div> </div>
