<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> All the long repressed tenderness of her nature overflowed to this girl who was unconscious of it. She was proud of Sylvia&rsquo;s grace and beauty, and sweetness of voice and laughter. She began to like the Spencer children because they worshipped Sylvia; she envied Mrs. Spencer because the latter could minister to Sylvia&rsquo;s needs. Even the egg pedlar seemed a delightful person because he brought news of Sylvia&mdash;her social popularity, her professional success, the love and admiration she had won already.</p><p>The Old Lady never dreamed of revealing herself to Sylvia. That, in her poverty, was not to be thought of for a moment. It would have been very sweet to know her&mdash;sweet to have her come to the old house&mdash;sweet to talk to her&mdash;to enter into her life. But it might not be. The Old Lady&rsquo;s pride was still far stronger than her love. It was the one thing she had never sacrificed and never&mdash;so she believed&mdash;could sacrifice.</p></div> </div>
