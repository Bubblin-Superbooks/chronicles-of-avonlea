<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When the Old Lady got home she took from her top bureau drawer an inlaid box of sandalwood. It held a little, slim, limp volume, wrapped in tissue paper&mdash;the Old Lady&rsquo;s most treasured possession. On the fly-leaf was written, &ldquo;To Margaret, with the author&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;</p><p>The Old Lady turned the yellow leaves with trembling fingers and, through eyes brimming with tears, read the verses, although she had known them all by heart for years. She meant to give the book to Sylvia for a birthday present&mdash;one of the most precious gifts ever given, if the value of gifts is gauged by the measure of self-sacrifice involved. In that little book was immortal love&mdash;old laughter&mdash;old tears&mdash;old beauty which had bloomed like a rose years ago, holding still its sweetness like old rose leaves.</p></div> </div>
