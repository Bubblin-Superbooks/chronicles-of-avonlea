<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Old Lady stopped talking. She felt sure Andrew Cameron would grant her request, but she did hope he would grant it rather rudely or unwillingly. She could accept the favour so much more easily if it were flung to her like a bone to a dog. But not a bit of it. Andrew Cameron was suaver than ever. Nothing could give him greater pleasure than to grant his dear Cousin Margaret&rsquo;s request&mdash;he only wished it involved more trouble on his part. Her little protege should have her musical education assuredly&mdash;she should go abroad next year&mdash;and he was DE-lighted&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the Old Lady, cutting him short again. &ldquo;I am much obliged to you&mdash;and I ask you not to let Miss Gray know anything of my interference. And I shall not take up any more of your valuable time. Good afternoon.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
