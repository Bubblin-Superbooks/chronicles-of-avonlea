I understand what he meant now.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned to meet Janet, who came into the study with a violin. Felix&rsquo;s heart throbbed; he recognized it. Mr. Leonard took it from Janet and held it out to the boy.</p><p>&ldquo;This is your father&rsquo;s violin, Felix. See to it that you never make your music the servant of the power of evil&mdash;never debase it to unworthy ends. For your responsibility is as your gift, and God will exact the accounting of it from you. Speak to the world in your own tongue through it, with truth and sincerity; and all I have hoped for you will be abundantly fulfilled.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
