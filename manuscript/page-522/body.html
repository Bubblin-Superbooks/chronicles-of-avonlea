To be candid&mdash;and oh, Louisa, candour is a rare thing among women when it comes to talking of the men&mdash;I believe I&rsquo;d rather be cooking Peter&rsquo;s meals and dusting his house. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind his bad grammar now. I&rsquo;ve learned one or two valuable little things out yonder, and one is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if a man&rsquo;s grammar is askew, so long as he doesn&rsquo;t swear at you. By the way, is Peter as ungrammatical as ever?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
