Her soft muslin became her much better, but we could not induce her to wear it. Anything more prim and bandboxy than Aunt Olivia when her toilet was finished it has never been my lot to see. Peggy and I watched her as she went downstairs, her skirt held stiffly up all around her that it might not brush the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Malcolm MacPherson&rsquo; will be inspired with such awe that he will only be able to sit back and gaze at her,&rdquo; whispered Peggy. &ldquo;I wish he would come and have it over. This is getting on my nerves.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
