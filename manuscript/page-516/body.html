<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get married, then?&rdquo; asked Louisa, paying an unconscious tribute to Nancy&rsquo;s perennial chance by her use of the present tense.</p><p>Nancy shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t suit me either. I don&rsquo;t want to be married. Do you remember that story Anne Shirley used to tell long ago of the pupil who wanted to be a widow because &lsquo;if you were married your husband bossed you and if you weren&rsquo;t married people called you an old maid?&rsquo; Well, that is precisely my opinion. I&rsquo;d like to be a widow. Then I&rsquo;d have the freedom of the unmarried, with the kudos of the married. I could eat my cake and have it, too. Oh, to be a widow!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
