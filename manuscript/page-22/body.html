<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;If Ludovic could be hurried up, I&rsquo;m not the one to do it. I&rsquo;m too shy. It sounds ridiculous to hear a woman of my age and inches say that, but it is true. Of course, I know it&rsquo;s the only way any Speed ever did make out to get married. For instance, there&rsquo;s a cousin of mine married to Ludovic&rsquo;s brother. I don&rsquo;t say she proposed to him out and out, but, mind you, Anne, it wasn&rsquo;t far from it. I couldn&rsquo;t do anything like that. I DID try once. When I realized that I was getting sere and mellow, and all the girls of my generation were going off on either hand, I tried to give Ludovic a hint. But it stuck in my throat. And now I don&rsquo;t mind. If I don&rsquo;t change Dix to Speed until I take the initiative, it will be Dix to the end of life. Ludovic doesn&rsquo;t realize that we are growing old, you know.</p></div> </div>
