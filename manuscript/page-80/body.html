The July Chapter</p><p>The first day of July Sylvia found a little birch bark boat full of strawberries at the beech in the hollow. They were the earliest of the season; the Old Lady had found them in one of her secret haunts. They would have been a toothsome addition to the Old Lady&rsquo;s own slender bill of fare; but she never thought of eating them. She got far more pleasure out of the thought of Sylvia&rsquo;s enjoying them for her tea. Thereafter the strawberries alternated with the flowers as long as they lasted, and then came blueberries and raspberries. The blueberries grew far away and the Old Lady had many a tramp after them. Sometimes her bones ached at night because of it; but what cared the Old Lady for that? Bone ache is easier to endure than soul ache; and the Old Lady&rsquo;s soul had stopped aching for the first time in many year. It was being nourished with heavenly manna.</p></div> </div>
