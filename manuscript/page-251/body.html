Lucinda and Romney are in love with each other. They have been in love with each other for fifteen years and in all that time they have never spoken to each other once!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. George, feeling the inadequacy of mere language. Was this a Penhallow method of courtship? &ldquo;But WHY?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
