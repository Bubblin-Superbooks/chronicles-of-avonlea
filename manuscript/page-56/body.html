And she might have been MY daughter,&rdquo; murmured the Old Lady. &ldquo;Oh, if I could only know her and love her&mdash;and perhaps win her love in return! But I cannot. I could not have Leslie Gray&rsquo;s daughter know how poor I am&mdash;how low I have been brought. I could not bear that. And to think she is living so near me, the darling&mdash;just up the lane and over the hill. I can see her go by every day&mdash;I can have that dear pleasure, at least. But oh, if I could only do something for her&mdash;give her some little pleasure! It would be such a delight.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
