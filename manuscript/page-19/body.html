You have to fight air when you spar with him.

Why don&rsquo;t you and Ludovic get married?&rdquo;</p><p>Theodora laughed comfortably.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question Grafton folks have been asking for quite a while, I reckon, Anne. Well, I&rsquo;d have no objection to marrying Ludovic. That&rsquo;s frank enough for you, isn&rsquo;t it? But it&rsquo;s not easy to marry a man unless he asks you. And Ludovic has never asked me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
