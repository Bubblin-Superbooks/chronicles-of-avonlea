<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;They had a quarrel fifteen years ago,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frederick patiently. &ldquo;Nobody knows how it originated or anything about it except that Lucinda herself admitted it to us afterwards. But, in the first flush of her rage, she told Romney that she would never speak to him again as long as she lived. And HE said he would never speak to her until she spoke first&mdash;because, you see, as she was in the wrong she ought to make the first advance. And they never have spoken. Everybody in the connection, I suppose, has taken turns trying to reconcile them, but nobody has succeeded. I don&rsquo;t believe that Romney has ever so much as THOUGHT of any other woman in his whole life, and certainly Lucinda has never thought of any other man. You will notice she still wears Romney&rsquo;s ring. They&rsquo;re practically engaged still, of course.</p></div> </div>
