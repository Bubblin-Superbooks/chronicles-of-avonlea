I didn&rsquo;t think it would be hard to do; and it wasn&rsquo;t. I went over the very next day because I saw Emmeline driving off to the store. I found Prissy alone, sewing carpet rags. Emmeline kept her constantly at that&mdash;because Prissy hated it I suppose. Prissy was crying when I went in, and in a few minutes I had the whole story.</p><p>Prissy wanted to get married&mdash;and she wanted to get married to Stephen&mdash;and Emmeline wouldn&rsquo;t let her.</p><p>&ldquo;Prissy Strong,&rdquo; I said in exasperation, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t the spirit of a mouse! Why on earth did you write him such a letter?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
