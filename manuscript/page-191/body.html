<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;If you repent, that is all that is necessary. God will forgive you if you ask Him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, He can&rsquo;t! Sins like mine can&rsquo;t be forgiven. He can&rsquo;t&mdash;and He won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He can and He will. He is a God of love, Naomi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Naomi with stubborn conviction. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a God of love at all. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m skeered of him. No, no. He&rsquo;s a God of wrath and justice and punishment. Love! There ain&rsquo;t no such thing as love! I&rsquo;ve never found it on earth, and I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s to be found in God.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
