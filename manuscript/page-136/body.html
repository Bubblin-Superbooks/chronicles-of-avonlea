<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&rsquo;m only sorry that I ever shut my neighbours out of my life because of my foolish pride. Everyone has been so kind to me, Sylvia. In the future, if my life is spared, it is going to be a very different sort of life. I&rsquo;m going to open it to all the kindness and companionship I can find in young and old. I&rsquo;m going to help them all I can and let them help me. I CAN help people&mdash;I&rsquo;ve learned that money isn&rsquo;t the only power for helping people. Anyone who has sympathy and understanding to give has a treasure that is without money and without price. And oh, Sylvia, you&rsquo;ve found out what I never meant you to know. But I don&rsquo;t mind that now, either.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
