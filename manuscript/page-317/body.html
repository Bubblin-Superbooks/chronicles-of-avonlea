Had I caught Peggy&rsquo;s eye when Aunt Olivia said &ldquo;Mr. Malcolm MacPherson&rdquo; in that tone I must have laughed, willy-nilly.</p><p>&ldquo;When I was a girl the MacPhersons used to live across the road from here. Mr. Malcolm MacPherson was my beau then. But my family&mdash;and your father especially&mdash;dear me, I do hope he won&rsquo;t be very cross&mdash;were opposed to his attentions and were very cool to him. I think that was why he never said anything to me about getting married then. And after a time he went away, as I have said, and I never heard anything from him directly for many a year. Of course, his sister sometimes gave me news of him. But last June I had a letter from him.</p></div> </div>
