<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When the pale, lovely dawn-colour came stealing up the sky behind the spruces, the Old Lady buried her face in her pillow and refused to look at it.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate the new day,&rdquo; she said rebelliously. &ldquo;It will be just like all the other hard, common days. I don&rsquo;t want to get up and live it. And, oh, to think that long ago I reached out my hands joyfully to every new day, as to a friend who was bringing me good tidings! I loved the mornings then&mdash;sunny or gray, they were as delightful as an unread book&mdash;and now I hate them&mdash;hate them&mdash;hate them!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
