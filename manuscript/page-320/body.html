<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We loved Aunt Olivia and were glad for her late, new-blossoming happiness; but we felt amused over it also. The recollection of her &ldquo;Mr. Malcolm MacPherson&rdquo; was too much for us every time we thought of it.</p><p>Father pooh-poohed incredulously at first, and, when we had convinced him, guffawed with laughter. Aunt Olivia need not have dreaded any more opposition from her cruel family.</p><p>&ldquo;MacPherson was a good fellow enough, but horribly poor,&rdquo; said father. &ldquo;I hear he has done very well out west, and if he and Olivia have a notion of each other they are welcome to marry as far as I am concerned. Tell Olivia she mustn&rsquo;t take a spasm if he tracks some mud into her house once in a while.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
