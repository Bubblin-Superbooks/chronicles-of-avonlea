It certainly did seem funny.</p><p>Stephen walked home with Prissy from prayer meeting four nights before Emmeline found it out. Emmeline hadn&rsquo;t been going to prayer meeting all that summer because she was mad at Mr. Leonard. She had expressed her disapproval to him because he had buried old Naomi Clark at the harbour &ldquo;just as if she was a Christian,&rdquo; and Mr. Leonard had said something to her she couldn&rsquo;t get over for a while. I don&rsquo;t know what it was, but I know that when Mr. Leonard WAS roused to rebuke anyone the person so rebuked remembered it for a spell.</p></div> </div>
