Joscelyn was kneeling by the bed, with her arms about Aunty Nan; and Aunty Nan, with her face all irradiated, was stroking Joscelyn&rsquo;s dark hair fondly.</p><p>&ldquo;O, little Joscelyn,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;it seems too good to be true. It seems like a beautiful dream. I knew you the minute you opened the door, my dearie. You haven&rsquo;t changed a bit. And you&rsquo;re a famous singer now, little Joscelyn! I always knew you would be. Oh, I want you to sing a piece for me&mdash;just one, won&rsquo;t you, dearie? Sing that piece people like to hear you sing best. I forget the name, but I&rsquo;ve read about it in the papers. Sing it for me, little Joscelyn.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
