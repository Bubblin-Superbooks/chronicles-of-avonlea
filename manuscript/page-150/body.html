<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What do you want to be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A great violinist,&rdquo; answered the child, his ivory-hued face suddenly warming into living rose. &ldquo;I want to play to thousands&mdash;and see their eyes look as yours do when I play. Sometimes your eyes frighten me, but oh, it&rsquo;s a splendid fright! If I had father&rsquo;s violin I could do better. I remember that he once said it had a soul that was doing purgatory for its sins when it had lived on earth. I don&rsquo;t know what he meant, but it did seem to me that HIS violin was alive. He taught me to play on it as soon as I was big enough to hold it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
