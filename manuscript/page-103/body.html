I am so grateful to her and I have wished so much she might know how much pleasure she has given me. I have found lovely flowers and delicious berries on my path all summer; I feel sure she sent me my party dress. But the dearest gift came last week on my birthday&mdash;a little volume of my father&rsquo;s poems. I can&rsquo;t express what I felt on receiving them. But I longed to meet my fairy godmother and thank her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quite a fascinating mystery, isn&rsquo;t it? Have you really no idea who she is?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
