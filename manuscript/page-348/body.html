It was so thorough and sudden as to be almost uncanny. The old maid vanished completely, and in her place was a woman, full to the lips with primitive emotion and pain.</p><p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she cried in a terrible voice. &ldquo;Mary&mdash;Peggy&mdash;what shall I do?&rdquo;</p><p>It was almost a shriek.
