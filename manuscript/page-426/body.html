<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Do you reckon we&rsquo;re going to keep this baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;dunno,&rdquo; said Pa. And he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re NOT. I brought up one boy and that&rsquo;s enough. I don&rsquo;t calculate to be pestered with any more. I never was much struck on children as children, anyhow. You say that Mary Garland had a brother out in Manitoba? Well, we shall just write to him and tell him he&rsquo;s got to look out for his nephew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how can you do that, Ma, when nobody knows his address?&rdquo; objected Pa, with a wistful look at that delicious, laughing baby.</p></div> </div>
