She was all but turning back to her room when Lionel Hezekiah came running in, and paused to look at her admiringly.</p><p>&ldquo;You look just bully, Aunt Salome,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that word, Lionel Hezekiah,&rdquo; pleaded Salome. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to church.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take me with you,&rdquo; said Lionel Hezekiah promptly. Salome shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, dear. Your Aunt Judith wouldn&rsquo;t like it. Perhaps she will let you go after a while. Now do be a good boy while I am away, won&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t do any naughty things.&rdquo; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do them if I know they&rsquo;re naughty,&rdquo; conceded Lionel Hezekiah. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just the trouble; I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s naughty and what ain&rsquo;t. Prob&rsquo;ly if I went to Sunday school I&rsquo;d find out.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
