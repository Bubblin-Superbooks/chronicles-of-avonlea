<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A strange looking man was old Abel Blair; and as strange was he as he looked. Lower Carmody people would have told you.</p><p>Old Abel was almost always sober in these, his later years. He was sober to-day. He liked to bask in that ripe sunlight as well as his dog and cat did; and in such baskings he almost always looked out of his doorway at the far, fine blue sky over the tops of the crowding maples. But to-day he was not looking at the sky, instead, he was staring at the black, dusty rafters of his kitchen, where hung dried meats and strings of onions and bunches of herbs and fishing tackle and guns and skins.</p></div> </div>
