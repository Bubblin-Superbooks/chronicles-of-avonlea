He never thinks of such a thing. I feel sure he WOULD forbid it, if he knew. And that makes me very wretched. And yet I HAVE to come. Mr. Blair, do you know why grandfather can&rsquo;t bear to have me play on the violin? He loves music, and he doesn&rsquo;t mind my playing on the organ, if I don&rsquo;t neglect other things. I can&rsquo;t understand it, can you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a pretty good idea, but I can&rsquo;t tell you. It isn&rsquo;t my secret. Maybe he&rsquo;ll tell you himself some day. But, mark you, young Felix, he has got good reasons for it all. Knowing what I know, I can&rsquo;t blame him over much, though I think he&rsquo;s mistaken.</p></div> </div>
