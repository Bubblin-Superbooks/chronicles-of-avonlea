<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It&rsquo;s shocking to think of the way she has lived all these years, often with not enough to eat&mdash;and going to bed in winter days to save fuel. Though I suppose if we had known we couldn&rsquo;t have done much for her, she&rsquo;s so desperate proud. But if she lives, and will let us help her, things will be different after this. Crooked Jack says he&rsquo;ll never forgive himself for taking pay for the few little jobs he did for her. He says, if she&rsquo;ll only let him, he&rsquo;ll do everything she wants done for her after this for nothing. Ain&rsquo;t it strange what a fancy she&rsquo;s took to Miss Gray? Think of her doing all those things for her all summer, and selling the grape jug and all. Well, the Old Lady certainly isn&rsquo;t mean, but nobody made a mistake in calling her queer. It all does seem desperate pitiful. Miss Gray&rsquo;s taking it awful hard.</p></div> </div>
