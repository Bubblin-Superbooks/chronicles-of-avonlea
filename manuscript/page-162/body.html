<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Grandfather&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he cried brokenly.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, now!&rdquo; Old Abel had risen deprecatingly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault, Mr. Leonard. Don&rsquo;t you blame the boy. I coaxed him to play a bit for me. I didn&rsquo;t feel fit to touch the fiddle yet myself&mdash;too soon after Friday, you see. So I coaxed him on&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t give him no peace till he played. It&rsquo;s all my fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Felix, throwing back his head. His face was as white as marble, yet it seemed ablaze with desperate truth and scorn of old Abel&rsquo;s shielding lie. &ldquo;No, grandfather, it isn&rsquo;t Abel&rsquo;s fault. I came over here on purpose to play, because I thought you had gone to the harbour. I have come here often, ever since I have lived with you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
