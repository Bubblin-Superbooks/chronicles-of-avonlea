<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Spencervale children held the Old Lady in mortal terror; some of them&mdash;the &ldquo;Spencer Road&rdquo; fry&mdash;believed she was a witch; all of them would run if, when wandering about the woods in search of berries or spruce gum, they saw at a distance the spare, upright form of the Old Lady, gathering sticks for her fire. Mary Moore was the only one who was quite sure she was not a witch.</p><p>&ldquo;Witches are always ugly,&rdquo; she said decisively, &ldquo;and Old Lady Lloyd isn&rsquo;t ugly. She&rsquo;s real pretty&mdash;she&rsquo;s got such a soft white hair and big black eyes and a little white face. Those Road children don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking of. Mother says they&rsquo;re a very ignorant crowd.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
