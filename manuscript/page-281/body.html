Here Old Man Shaw set out his orchard and saw it flourish, watching and tending it until he came to know each tree as a child and loved it. His neighbours laughed at him, and said that the fruit of an orchard so far away from the house would all be stolen. But as yet there was no fruit, and when the time came for bearing there would be enough and to spare.</p><p>&ldquo;Blossom and me&rsquo;ll get all we want, and the boys can have the rest, if they want &lsquo;em worse&rsquo;n they want a good conscience,&rdquo; said that unworldly, unbusinesslike Old Man Shaw.</p></div> </div>
