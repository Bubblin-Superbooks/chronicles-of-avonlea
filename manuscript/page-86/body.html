Everybody wondered why she went; most people supposed she had become too frightened to keep her money in a black box below her bed, when there had been two burglaries over at Carmody, and had taken it to the bank.</p><p>The Old Lady sought out the address of the china collector, trembling with fear that she might be dead or gone.

Old Lady Lloyd felt like a traitor to her traditions.</p></div> </div>
