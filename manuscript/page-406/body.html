I shall never call you Peter. Angelina just suits you exactly; and Angelina Bennett would suit you still better. You must come back, Angelina. Mr. Riley is moping for you, and I can&rsquo;t get along without somebody to appreciate my sarcasms, now that you have accustomed me to the luxury.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about the other five cats?&rdquo; I demanded.</p><p>Alexander Abraham sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;ll have to come too,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;though no doubt they&rsquo;ll chase poor Mr. Riley clean off the premises. But I can live without him, and I can&rsquo;t without you. How soon can you be ready to marry me?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
