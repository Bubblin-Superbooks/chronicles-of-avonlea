<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When the Old Lady happened to go into her spare room that evening, she saw from it a light shining through a gap in the trees on the hill. She knew that it shone from the Spencers&rsquo; spare room. So it was Sylvia&rsquo;s light. The Old Lady stood in the darkness and watched it until it went out&mdash;watched it with a great sweetness breathing in her heart, such as risen from old rose-leaves when they are stirred. She fancied Sylvia moving about her room, brushing and braiding her long, glistening hair&mdash;laying aside her little trinkets and girlish adornments&mdash;making her simple preparations for sleep. When the light went out the Old Lady pictured a slight white figure kneeling by the window in the soft starshine, and the Old Lady knelt down then and there and said her own prayers in fellowship.</p></div> </div>
