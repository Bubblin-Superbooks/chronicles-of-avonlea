<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> People who make a hobby of heirloom china must meekly overlook snubs, and this particular person had never seen anything she coveted so much as that grape jug.</p><p>The Old Lady had torn the card to pieces; but she remembered the name and address. She went to the cupboard and took down the beloved jug.</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought to part with it,&rdquo; she said wistfully, &ldquo;but Sylvia must have a dress, and there is no other way. And, after all, when I&rsquo;m gone, who would there be to have it? Strangers would get it then&mdash;it might as well go to them now. I&rsquo;ll have to go to town to-morrow morning, for there&rsquo;s no time to lose if the party is Friday night. I haven&rsquo;t been to town for ten years. I dread the thought of going, more than parting with the jug. But for Sylvia&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
