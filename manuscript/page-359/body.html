If it had not been for one thing&mdash;which I would never in this world have admitted to Mrs. Allan&mdash;I might have liked the girls&rsquo; class best myself. But the truth was, Anne Shirley was in that class; and Anne Shirley was the one living human being that I was afraid of. Not that I disliked her. But she had such a habit of asking weird, unexpected questions, which a Philadelphia lawyer couldn&rsquo;t answer. Miss Rogerson had that class once and Anne routed her, horse, foot and artillery. I wasn&rsquo;t going to undertake a class with a walking interrogation point in it like that. Besides, I thought Mrs. Allan required a slight snub.</p></div> </div>
