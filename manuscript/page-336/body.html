He would say, with his big, jolly laugh, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be minding the little girls,&rdquo; and pull her down on his knee and hold her there. To my dying day I shall never forget the expression on the poor little woman&rsquo;s face.</p><p>But, as the days went by and Mr. Malcolm MacPherson began to insist on a date being set for the wedding, Aunt Olivia grew to have a strangely disturbed look. She became very quiet, and never laughed except under protest. Also, she showed signs of petulance when any of us, but especially father, teased her about her beau. I pitied her, for I think I understood better than the others what her feelings really were. But even I was not prepared for what did happen. I would not have believed that Aunt Olivia could do it.</p></div> </div>
