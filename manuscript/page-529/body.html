New churches are an abomination.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you see Peter Wright in church?&rdquo; asked Louisa. She had been bursting to ask it.</p><p>Nancy nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Verily, yes. He sat right across from me in the corner pew. I didn&rsquo;t think him painfully changed. Iron-gray hair becomes him. But I was horribly disappointed in myself. I had expected to feel at least a romantic thrill, but all I felt was a comfortable interest, such as I might have taken in any old friend.
