<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The minister, thinking it well to strike while the iron was hot, went up to call on Old Lady Lloyd the very next afternoon. He went in fear and trembling, for he had heard things about Old Lady Lloyd; but she made herself so agreeable in her high-bred fashion that he was delighted, and told his wife when he went home that Spencervale people didn&rsquo;t understand Miss Lloyd. This was perfectly true; but it is by no means certain that the minister understood her either.</p><p>He made only one mistake in tact, but, as the Old Lady did not snub him for it, he never knew he made it. When he was leaving he said, &ldquo;I hope we shall see you at church next Sunday, Miss Lloyd.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
