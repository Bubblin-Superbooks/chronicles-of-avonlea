<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Pa Sloane drove back home, with the sorrel mare still unshod, the baby, and the baby&rsquo;s meager bundle of clothes. The baby did not trouble him much; it had become well used to strangers in the past two months, and promptly fell asleep on his arm; but Pa Sloane did not enjoy that drive; at the end of it he mentally saw Ma Sloane.</p><p>Ma was there, too, waiting for him on the back door-step as he drove into the yard at sunset. Her face, when she saw the baby, expressed the last degree of amazement.</p><p>&ldquo;Pa Sloane,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;whose is that young one, and where did you get it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
