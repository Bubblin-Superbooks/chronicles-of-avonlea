The August Chapter</p><p>One day the minister&rsquo;s wife rushed in where Spencervale people had feared to tread, went boldly to Old Lady Lloyd, and asked her if she wouldn&rsquo;t come to their Sewing Circle, which met fortnightly on Saturday afternoons.</p><p>&ldquo;We are filling a box to send to our Trinidad missionary,&rdquo; said the minister&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;and we should be so pleased to have you come, Miss Lloyd.&rdquo;</p><p>The Old Lady was on the point of refusing rather haughtily. Not that she was opposed to missions&mdash;or sewing circles either&mdash;quite the contrary, but she knew that each member of the Circle was expected to pay ten cents a week for the purpose of procuring sewing materials; and the poor Old Lady really did not see how she could afford it. But a sudden thought checked her refusal before it reached her lips.</p></div> </div>
