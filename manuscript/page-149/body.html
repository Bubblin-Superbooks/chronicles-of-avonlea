<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Not a pulpit minister. There&rsquo;s different kinds of ministers, and each must talk to men in his own tongue if he&rsquo;s going to do &lsquo;em any real good,&rdquo; said old Abel meditatively. &ldquo;YOUR tongue is music. Strange that your grandfather can&rsquo;t see that for himself, and him such a broad-minded man! He&rsquo;s the only minister I ever had much use for. He&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s own if ever a man was. And he loves you&mdash;yes, sir, he loves you like the apple of his eye.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I love him,&rdquo; said Felix warmly. &ldquo;I love him so much that I&rsquo;ll even try to be a minister for his sake, though I don&rsquo;t want to be.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
