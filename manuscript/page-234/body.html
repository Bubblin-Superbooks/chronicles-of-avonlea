And what have you done with her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was Miss Joscelyn Burnett,&rdquo; said Jordan, expanding himself. This was his hour of triumph over Mrs. William. &ldquo;I went to Kensington and brung her out to see Aunty Nan. She&rsquo;s up with her now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Mrs. William helplessly. &ldquo;And me in my milking rig! Jordan, for pity&rsquo;s sake, hold the baby while I go and put on my black silk. You might have given a body some warning. I declare I don&rsquo;t know which is the greatest idiot, you or Aunty Nan!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
