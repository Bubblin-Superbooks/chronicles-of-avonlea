<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>They were visiting me that afternoon. Diana&rsquo;s mother was my second cousin, and, as we visited back and forth frequently, I&rsquo;d often seen Diana. But I&rsquo;d never seen her chum, Anne Shirley, although I&rsquo;d heard enough about her to drive anyone frantic with curiosity. So when she came home from Redmond College that summer I asked Diana to take pity on me and bring her over some afternoon.</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed in her. I considered her a beauty, though some people couldn&rsquo;t see it. She had the most magnificent red hair and the biggest, shiningest eyes I ever saw in a girl&rsquo;s head. As for her laugh, it made me feel young again to hear it. She and Diana both laughed enough that afternoon, for I told them, under solemn promise of secrecy, all about poor Prissy&rsquo;s love affair. So nothing would do them but they must go over with me.</p></div> </div>
