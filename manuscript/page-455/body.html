She was all in a quiver of excitement, and looked ten years younger.</p><p>&ldquo;Priscilla Strong, you&rsquo;ve been expecting Stephen Clark here this evening!&rdquo; burst out Emmeline. &ldquo;You wicked, deceitful, underhanded, ungrateful creature!&rdquo;</p><p>And she went on storming at Prissy, who began to cry, and looked so weak and babyish that I was frightened she would betray the whole thing.</p><p>&ldquo;This is between you and Prissy, Emmeline,&rdquo; I struck in, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not going to interfere.
