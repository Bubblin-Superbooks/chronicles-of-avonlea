He probably thought I was brewing up lots of trouble for myself, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. As soon as he was out of the way I casually remarked to Stephen that I understood that he was going to take one of my neighbours away and that I couldn&rsquo;t be sorry, though she was an excellent neighbour and I would miss her a great deal.</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to miss her much, I reckon,&rdquo; said Stephen grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told I&rsquo;m not wanted there.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
