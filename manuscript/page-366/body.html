<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I never stop to argue matters with a dog that doesn&rsquo;t bark. I know when discretion is the better part of valour. Firmly clasping William Adolphus, I ran&mdash;not to the door, because the dog was between me and it, but to a big, low-branching cherry tree at the back corner of the house. I reached it in time and no more. First thrusting William Adolphus on to a limb above my head, I scrambled up into that blessed tree without stopping to think how it might look to Alexander Abraham if he happened to be watching.</p><p>My time for reflection came when I found myself perched half way up the tree with William Adolphus beside me. William Adolphus was quite calm and unruffled. I can hardly say with truthfulness what I was. On the contrary, I admit that I felt considerably upset.</p></div> </div>
