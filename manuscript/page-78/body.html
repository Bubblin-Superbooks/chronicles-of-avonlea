I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d like to know her. I&rsquo;d be afraid of her&mdash;she has such stately ways and such strange, piercing eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of her,&rdquo; said Sylvia to herself, as she turned into the Spencer lane. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t expect I&rsquo;ll ever become acquainted with her. If she knew who I am I suppose she would dislike me. I suppose she never suspects that I am Leslie Gray&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
