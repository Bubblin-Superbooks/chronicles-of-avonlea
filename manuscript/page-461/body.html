<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The appearance of the house amazed me. All the shutters were closed and the door locked. I knocked and knocked, but there was no answer. Then I walked around the house to the only window that hadn&rsquo;t shutters&mdash;a tiny one upstairs. I knew it was the window in the closet off the room where the girls slept. I stopped under it and called Prissy. Before long Prissy came and opened it. She was so pale and woe-begone looking that I pitied her with all my heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Prissy, where has Emmeline gone?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Down to Avonlea to see the Roger Pyes. They&rsquo;re sick with measles, and Emmeline couldn&rsquo;t take me because I&rsquo;ve never had measles.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
