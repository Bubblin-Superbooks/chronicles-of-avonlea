He is a first cousin of Lucinda&rsquo;s and a second of George&rsquo;s&mdash;or is he? Oh, bother! You must go to Uncle John if you want the genealogy. I&rsquo;m in a chronic muddle concerning Penhallow relationship. And, as for Romney, of course you can speak to him about anything you like except Lucinda. Oh, you innocent! To ask him if he didn&rsquo;t think Lucinda was looking well! And right before her, too! Of course he thought you did it on purpose to tease him. That was what made him so savage and sarcastic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But WHY?&rdquo; persisted Mrs. George, sticking tenaciously to her point.</p></div> </div>
