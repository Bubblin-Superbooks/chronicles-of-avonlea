The Old Lady went without supper that night because of it, but Chris never knew that.</p><p>The Old Lady thought it a most beautiful June. She no longer hated the new days; on the contrary, she welcomed them.</p><p>&ldquo;Every day is an uncommon day now,&rdquo; she said jubilantly to herself&mdash;for did not almost every day bring her a glimpse of Sylvia? Even on rainy days the Old Lady gallantly braved rheumatism to hide behind her clump of dripping spruces and watch Sylvia pass.</p></div> </div>
