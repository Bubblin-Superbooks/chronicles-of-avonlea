<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The doctor came down from Alexander Abraham&rsquo;s room looking grave.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to pronounce on the disease yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no certainty until the eruption appears. But, of course, there is every likelihood that it is the smallpox. It is very unfortunate. I am afraid that it will be difficult to get a nurse. All the nurses in town who will take smallpox cases are overbusy now, for the epidemic is still raging there. However, I&rsquo;ll go into town to-night and do my best. Meanwhile, at present, you must not go near him, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to take orders from any man, and as soon as the doctor had gone I marched straight up to Alexander Abraham&rsquo;s room with some dinner for him on a tray. There was a lemon cream I thought he could eat even if he had the smallpox.</p></div> </div>
