<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Janet Moore and Sylvia Gray walked home from church together. &ldquo;Did you see Old Lady Lloyd out to-day?&rdquo; asked Janet. &ldquo;I was amazed when she walked in. She has never been to church in my recollection. What a quaint old figure she is! She&rsquo;s very rich, you know, but she wears her mother&rsquo;s old clothes and never gets a new thing. Some people think she is mean; but,&rdquo; concluded Janet charitably, &ldquo;I believe it is simply eccentricity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I felt that was Miss Lloyd as soon as I saw her, although I had never seen her before,&rdquo; said Sylvia dreamily. &ldquo;I have been wishing to see her&mdash;for a certain reason. She has a very striking face. I should like to meet her&mdash;to know her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
