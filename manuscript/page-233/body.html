An arc of warm gold was over the spruces behind the house. Mrs. William was out in the barn-yard, milking, and the house was deserted, save for the sleeping baby in the kitchen and the little old woman with the watchful eyes in the up-stairs room.</p><p>&ldquo;This way, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Jordan, inwardly congratulating himself that the coast was clear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you right up to her room.&rdquo;</p><p>Up-stairs, Joscelyn tapped at the half-open door and went in. Before it closed behind her, Jordan heard Aunty Nan say, &ldquo;Joscelyn! Little Joscelyn!&rdquo; in a tone that made him choke again.
