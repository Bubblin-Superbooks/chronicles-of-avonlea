<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nancy stayed. She sat at the head of Peter&rsquo;s table and poured his tea for him. She talked to him wittily of the Avonlea people and the changes in their old set. Peter followed her lead with an apparent absence of self-consciousness, eating his supper like a man whose heart and mind were alike on good terms with him. Nancy felt wretched&mdash;and, at the same time, ridiculously happy. It seemed the most grotesque thing in the world that she should be presiding there at Peter&rsquo;s table, and yet the most natural. There were moments when she felt like crying&mdash;other moments when her laughter was as ready and spontaneous as a girl&rsquo;s. Sentiment and humour had always waged an equal contest in Nancy&rsquo;s nature.</p></div> </div>
