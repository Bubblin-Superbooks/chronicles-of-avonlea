<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was always hardest in the spring. Once upon a time the Old Lady&mdash;when she had not been the Old Lady, but pretty, wilful, high-spirited Margaret Lloyd&mdash;had loved springs; now she hated them because they hurt her; and this particular spring of this particular May chapter hurt her more than any that had gone before. The Old Lady felt as if she could NOT endure the ache of it. Everything hurt her&mdash;the new green tips on the firs, the fairy mists down in the little beech hollow below the house, the fresh smell of the red earth Crooked Jack spaded up in her garden. The Old Lady lay awake all one moonlit night and cried for very heartache. She even forgot her body hunger in her soul hunger; and the Old Lady had been hungry, more or less, all that week. She was living on store biscuits and water, so that she might be able to pay Crooked Jack for digging her garden.</p></div> </div>
