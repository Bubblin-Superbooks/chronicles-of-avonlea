What&rsquo;ll she think of it after her aunt&rsquo;s? I&rsquo;ve heard tell Mrs. Adair lives in a perfect palace. I&rsquo;ll just warn you kindly that Sary&rsquo;ll probably look down on you, and you might as well be prepared for it. Of course, I suppose she kind of thinks she has to come back, seeing she promised you so solemn she would. But I&rsquo;m certain she doesn&rsquo;t want to, and I don&rsquo;t blame her either.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
