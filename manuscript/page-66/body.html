<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>II. The June Chapter</p><p>There were no Mayflowers in June; but now the Old Lady&rsquo;s garden was full of blossoms and every morning Sylvia found a bouquet of them by the beech&mdash;the perfumed ivory of white narcissus, the flame of tulips, the fairy branches of bleeding-heart, the pink-and-snow of little, thorny, single, sweetbreathed early roses. The Old Lady had no fear of discovery, for the flowers that grew in her garden grew in every other Spencervale garden as well, including the Stewart garden. Chris Stewart, when he was teased about the music teacher, merely smiled and held his peace. Chris knew perfectly well who was the real giver of those flowers. He had made it his business to find out when the Mayflower gossip started. But since it was evident Old Lady Lloyd did not wish it to be known, Chris told no one.</p></div> </div>
